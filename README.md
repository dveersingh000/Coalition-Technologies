# Los Angeles Mountains

## Description

PSD (Photoshop) design into HTML. I extracted the images from the provided file and implemented the instructions for creating a fully responsive website. To achieve this, I used a snippet from bootsnipp.com to ensure the carousel would adapt to different screen sizes. Additionally, I utilized Bootstrap to transform the carousel into an accordion when the website was viewed on a mobile screen.
